# New Validator - Pre Server Steps
---
Here's what you need to get done before you start setting up server equipment or virtual private servers. There's a lot of stuff to cover before you even create a node. 

## TL;DR
---
Here's the TL;DR of what we cover on the next few pages of this section but that won't help you get a node running. You'll have to go through each of these on your path to becoming a validator.

* Sign up on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b761e5fdd694) and rent server, or utilize another provider of your choice
* Determine shard choice. Personal Preference but we strongly encourage _**NOT Shard 0**_ for many reasons for new validators.
  * \(1-3 recommended at this time for single key validators\)
* Create ssh key pub/priv pairs for use to auth on cloud provider service
* Create a github account and upload your .pub key to it so you can see it @ github.com/username.keys
* Create a brand for your validator
* Create a keybase account with your validator logo
* Setup SSH tools for your workstation \(Will you be using Windows or MAC to connect to your Ubuntu Linux Server?\) - Mobaxterm is our windows recommendation
* After going through the validator toolbox installation - You will need to "create a validator wallet" on the blockchain and add BLS Keys. Be sure to read the [First Time (One Time)](../../installation/first-time.html) Setup Steps before running the menu application!
