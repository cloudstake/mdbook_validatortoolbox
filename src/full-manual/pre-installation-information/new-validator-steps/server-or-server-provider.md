# Server or Server Provider

## Hardware \(or cloud\) Requirements

Review the current [hardware requirements here](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/server-setup/requirements).

For shards 1-3 we recommend a 2CPU CPU Optimized Server w/ a 300GB Volume attached \($70/mo as of 9/26/2021, disk size increases over time\)

For shard 0 use 2x the CPU power 

## Cloud Providers

There's unlimited options on who to rent a server from. We've tried many, we suggest the following if you're looking for a cloud hosted server.

* Sign up on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b761e5fdd694) and get $100 for your first 2 months fees - You can signup before creating servers to lock in your account.
* [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8873853) - A good option as well for a 2nd server on a different provider for redundancy

Other Providers, server purchase required to signup:

* [OVHCloud ](https://us.ovhcloud.com/)\(USA\)- We use a bare metal server ADV-2 from OVH for our workhorse backbone server, make sure you get 1Gbps speed + or you may have signing issues
* [OVH.com](https://www.ovh.com/world/) \(Outside USA\) - Several have reported good servers from OVH

## Why do you push Digital Ocean?

There's many reasons but mostly how easy they are to use, the reliability and the cost.

**Benefits of using Digital Ocean**:

* $100 in free credit. You're gonna need it if you aren't rich.
* Website is super easy to use to create servers & setup your firewall
* Volumes
  1. Since Harmony's data size has grown volumes help keep costs down
  2. They can be expanded live, on the fly, without shutting off harmony
  3. Don't spend too much extra cash on storage!!!!
