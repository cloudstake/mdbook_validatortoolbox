# Our Software

Easy Node is a longtime Linux house using it as a daily desktop for many years before being a Linux Systems Administrator full time for the last 15+ years.

We started validating in March and just going through [docs.harmony.one](https://docs.harmony.one) we knew there had to be an easier way for validators to get started with Harmony ONE Protocol.

## Validator Companion Guide

We first added to the community by producing a living guide to use before/during/after installing the Harmony Validator Software.

After it was created we realized that most of the things you need to know to setup a validator no longer matter once you're online and operational.

Sure, there's certain tasks you'll need to do as an administrator but perhaps we can provide some tools to automate most of those.

## Validator's Toolbox & Easy Node Installer Applications

In early July 2021 we started coding a menu application to help us manage our own nodes. This idea quickly spread to an application that could be used by anyone to manage their Regular Validator Signing Server Node.

Once the idea was proposed we were approached with the idea of making it beginner friendly as well as an option for people who simply need to run a "Full Node" on the Harmony blockchain without signing blocks \(developer and application use\).

## Github

Our software is now available on our github page below!
